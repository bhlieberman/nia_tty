Canto IV
The Gardens of Rosetta Seen from A Dahabiah
Outskirts of Cairo

Skimming along the Nile I see two banks going past covered
With flowers, birds' wings, flashes of light, lush green plants,
One of which would suffice for twenty of our salons
With its opaque foliage, lightly coloured stripes and fruits.
