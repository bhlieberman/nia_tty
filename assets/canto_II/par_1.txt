(Deduction from first principles is natural to mankind;
He extracts: from an insignificant event, like the fall of an apple,
A law which will consecrate him to immortality;
From a fable or tale, a moral;
From a thin scarecrow, a simple cross which stands
- Its posture suggesting terrible distress,
Shirt on its back, felt-hat on its head -
A marker of territory forbidden to birds;)
