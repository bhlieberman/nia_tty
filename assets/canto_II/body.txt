Canto II
The Battle-Field of The Pyramids

This battlefield conjures up nothing but the memory of him
At the time of the overcoat - that full-length greatcoat -
And the little hat - from which we can deduce
Intimidating rays of power emanating in all directions -
Grey overcoat, black hat (the image of which irresistibly evokes
The era when Kings were brought low
And which historians cannot leave alone;)
Worn by him up to the point when, on his craggy rock,
It no longer exaggerated his silhouette,
A fact which causes one to forget for a moment, lost in meditation,
Egypt, its sun, its evenings, its sky.
